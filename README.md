# Notes

**What is JavaScript?**

-  JavaScript is a high level multi-paradign object-oriented Programming language.
  
-  It is also Synchronous and single threaded in Behavior

  
-  It is the Language of the Web and is used to make web pages and web applications work Dynamically.

**JavaScript on the Browser?**

- Almost Every Browser today is Empowered by JavaScript.

- Every browser has an embedded JavaScript engine.
  > For example, - Chrome uses V8 Engine, Mozilla firefox uses spider monkey.

- JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive".

- The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

**JavaScript in the Browser**
```
console.log('Welcome to JavaScript');
VM1239:1 Welcome to JavaScript
undefined
alert('This is an alert message');
```

```
let a = 2;
undefined
console.log(a);
VM1532:1 2
undefined
40+2+8
50
```

**What is Node.js?**

**Node.js** is an open-sounce, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the VS engine and executes JaavaSeript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

It was Developed by Ryan Dahi and It uses Chrome's V8 engine.

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

**Variables in JavaScript**

> Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

> Variable means **anything that can very**. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.

**The var keyword**

- This is a reserved keyword in JavaScript which is to declare variables that is the 'var' keyword
```
> var a = 20;

> var greet = "Hello"

> var persionName = 'Supriyo Das'

> var isAvailable = true
```

**Dynamically vs Statically typed Languages**

- Statically typed languages: each variable and expression is already known at compile time.

example:
``` c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 20;

    char ch = 'G';

    double b = 2.5;

    printf("%d, %c, %lf", a, ch, b);
}
```

- Dynamically typed languages: variables can receive different values at run time and their type is defined at run time.

``` JS
> var a = 20;

> var greet = "Hello"

> var persionName = 'Supriyo Das'

> var isAvailable = true
```
