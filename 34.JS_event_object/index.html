            In JavaScript, event objects are the messengers that bring context to event handler functions. When an event like a button click or a key press occurs, an event object containing details about the event is passed to the corresponding event handler. This object holds information like the event type ("click", "keydown"), the element that triggered it (the button, the key), and methods to control how the event propagates. By examining these properties within the event object, event handlers can make informed decisions. They can check the event type to perform specific actions, identify the triggering element for targeted effects, or even prevent default behaviors associated with the event. Event objects are fundamental for building interactive web pages, as they enable event handlers to react in a meaningful way to user interactions and other events.
